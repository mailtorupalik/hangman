# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#


#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#    d=Dictionary.create(:word=>'airport',:word=>'album',:word=>'clock',:word=>'hammer');

   Dictionaries=Dictionary.create([{word: 'eraser'},{word: 'table' },{word: 'chair'},{word: 'desktop'},{word: 'word'}])
